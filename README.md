# FCC-Tribute-Page
Tribute page project for freeCodeCamp
This was the first project I completed while doing the Front End Development course on freeCodeCamp.com. The goal was to recreate a tribute page similar to https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW. With an emphasis on having an image related to the text and a clickable link.
